# odin-landingpage

## Description
A landing page created based on a provided screenshot of a design (01.png in the "img" folder).

I filled the design with some of my own content, envisioning a flower boquet delivery business called "Flowerr ðŸŒ»".

My iteration of this project adheres to the guidelines set out by the maintainers of **The Odin Project**, a self-paced curriculum for learning web development (links at the bottom).

**Why did I complete this project?:** To better understand and practice CSS styling and flexbox.

## What I Learned
- "box-sizing: border-box" includes the padding and border in an element's overall width and height, instead of padding and border being added to width or height, reducing the need for quick mental math when calculating CSS styles.
- How to use "flex-basis" to set the intial size of an element to a specific or relative size.
- How to use the "fit-content" property so that the width of an element's parent matches the width of the content/text inside of it, but if the content container runs out of space, the content inside can wrap to a new line. 
- How to use "flex-wrap" to allow flex items to wrap onto multiple lines.
